<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.

## Setup

- `pnpm install` (locked to pnpm 10 via `packageManager`) in the repo root.
- Copy `.env.local.example` → `.env.local`. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL`, and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (32+ chars, match
  production entropy). Also set `SITE_URL` in the **Convex dashboard** env vars
  (not `.env.local`) — `convex/auth.ts` and Better Auth read it from there.
- `opencode.json` sets `permission.edit: "ask"` and `permission.bash.*: "ask"` —
  expect approval prompts for write/file-system commands.

## Commands

| Intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Dev server | `pnpm dev` |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` (ESLint via `eslint.config.mjs`) |
| Format | `pnpm format` (Prettier), `pnpm format:check` |
| Typecheck | `pnpm build` runs `next build` (includes TS type-checking via Next plugin) |
| Tests (edge-runtime) | `pnpm test:ci` — vitest, edge-runtime, `app/**/*.test.ts`, `lib/**/*.test.ts`, `convex/**/*.test.ts` |
| Component tests | `pnpm test:component` — vitest with jsdom, `app/**/*.test.tsx`, auto-cleanup via `vitest.ui.setup.ts` |
| Single test file | `pnpm test -- <path>` (vitest in watch mode) |
| Build | `pnpm build` |

## Routing

- `app/(app)/` — logged-in experience (has Navbar). Parens = not part of URL,
  so `/blog` maps to `app/(app)/blog/page.tsx`.
- `app/auth/` — isolated layout, no Navbar, full-screen centered forms.
- Server Components for read-only pages (`fetchQuery`). Client Components
  (`"use client"`) for hooks, mutations, providers, interactivity.

## Convex + Better Auth

- Better Auth runs **inside Convex**. User/session records live in the same
  Convex DB as app data. Auth flows: browser → Next.js route handler
  (`app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`) → Convex HTTP (`convex/http.ts`).
- `ConvexClientProvider` sets `expectAuth: true` — Convex queries/mutations
  won't fire until the user is authenticated. This can confuse agents
  debugging "no data" issues in unauthenticated contexts.
- Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` in sync with
  the Convex dashboard deployment. `SITE_URL` goes in Convex dashboard env
  vars only.

## UI

- `components/ui/` are shadcn primitives — re-generate via `pnpm shadcn add`
  instead of editing manually. `components.json` has the config.
- Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/postcss`. CSS vars in `globals.css`.

## CI order

Before PR: `pnpm lint` → `pnpm test:ci` → `pnpm test:component` → `pnpm build`.
